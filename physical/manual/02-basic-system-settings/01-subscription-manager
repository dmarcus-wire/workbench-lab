When auto-attaching a system, the subscription service checks if the system is physical or virtual, as well as how many sockets are on the system. A physical system usually consumes two entitlements, a virtual system usually consumes one. One entitlement is consumed per two sockets on a system.

```
# subscription-manager register --username [username] --password [password]
# subscription-manager role --set="Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server"
# subscription-manager service-level --set="Self-Support"
# subscription-manager usage --set="Development/Test"
# subscription-manager attach
```
