## Background
When installing memory modules, the DIMM slots should be populated in the following order:
DIMMA1, DIMMB1, then DIMMA2, DIMMB2.
* Always use DDR4 DIMM modules of the same size, type and speed. Mixing memory
modules of different types and speeds is not allowed.
* The motherboard will support one DIMM module installed. However, for best memory performance, install DIMM modules in pairs.
Caution: Exercise extreme care when installing or removing DIMM modules to prevent
damage.

## Installing Memory
Begin by removing power from the system as described in Section 2.1.
1. Starting with P1-DIMMA1, push the release tabs outwards on both ends of the DIMM
slot to unlock it.
1. Align the key of the DIMM with the receptive point on the memory slot and with your
thumbs on both ends of the module, press it straight down into the slot until the module
snaps into place.
1. Press the release tabs to the locked position to secure the DIMM module into the slot.
