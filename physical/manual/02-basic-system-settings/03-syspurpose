You use System Purpose to record the intended use of a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 system, and ensure that the entitlement server auto-attaches the most appropriate subscription to your system. The syspurpose command-line tool is part of the python3_syspurpose.rpm package

# syspurpose set-role "Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server"
# syspurpose set-sla "Self-Support"
# syspurpose set-usage "Development/Test"
# syspurpose show
